This project aim to provide an api endpoint that execute multiple action and return result as json.

Like : 
I need to make a SQL Query to a DB but we don't have a native api endpoint
I need to query a LDAP server
I want to get data from another api endpoint
I need to make an snmpquery
I need to send an snmptrap

All definition of api endpoint and actions are defined in a json file.
So it's useless to change software code except for a new module.
